This is a program for k means clustering path from a source.

Implements:
            1. Given a parameter k, clusters the data into k centroids.
            2. First, we calculate the follower count for each user in twitter dataset given to us.
            3. Then for each follower count, we check the difference between the centroid and the follower count.
            The follower count is assigned to the centroid which it is closest to.
            4. The centroid is updated each time, by calculating the mean of the data objects in that cluster.
