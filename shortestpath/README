This is a program to find shortest path from a source.

Implements:
            1. Given a parameter k, randomly sample approximately k distinct users from the Twitter data.
            2. Run k-source shortest path for all k users together. This computes the shortest path from each of the k source vertices to all vertices in the graph (including the sources). It is similar to the single-source program but requires maintaining the distances from each of the k source vertices, instead of just a single source. (This not the same as running single-source shortest path k times!)
            3. Return the longest shortest path for each of the k source vertices.
